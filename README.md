# Blazor-Website
An E-Commerce Website with Blazor WebAssembly, a Web API, Entity Framework Core &amp; SQL Server Express.


I'm going to build an e-commerce web application with .NET 6 and Blazor WebAssembly in this project as a DEMO to briefly show my .net skill by using the Blazor framework.

Iâ€™ll cover the tech stack, meaning Blazor for the client, a Web API for the back-end web service, and Entity Framework Core with SQL Server Express for the database.

DO NOT LEAVE! I'll keep updating this page from today! ðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ª
